#Quran on Flask

This tutorial renders the Quranic text through a flask framework for illustrative purposes.

#v0.1 

The read me file creation

#v0.2

establish the basic framework. 

Display 'hello world' at the root address

also, display the url to listen on all ports '0.0.0.0', in my case the link is

http://data-abdulbaqi.c9.io

#v0.3

added a new route (/chapter/verse) with a mock message

#v0.4

This version does a significant improvement over the last version.

It brought the Quranic text from http://tanzil.net/download/

It then created a new py file called `q.py` which contans Q class to load the Quran into a dictionary and a function within this class to return a verse given its number.
